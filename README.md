)
async def main():
    # Start client and login
    await client.start()
    # Search for Attack on Titan

#### Downloading content 🔑

Crunchyroll has recently implemented the Widevine and PlayReady **Digital Rights Management (DRM)** systems, which has led to challenges for certain users attempting to download content from the platform.

Subsequently, the following code provides an illustrative example of obtaining decryption keys through the utilities of the [pywidevine](https://github.com/devine-dl/pywidevine) library and an L3 Content Decryption Module (CDM).

```py3
from pywidevine.cdm import Cdm
from pywidevine.pssh import PSSH
from pywidevine.device import Device
...
device = Device.load("l3cdm.wvd")
cdm = Cdm.from_device(device)
# Get streams of the episode/movie
streams = await client.get_streams("GRVDQ1G4R")
# Get manifest of the format you prefer
manifest = await client.get_manifest(streams.hardsubs[0].url)
# print(manifest)
# Get Widevine PSSH from manifest
pssh = PSSH(manifest.content_protection.widevine.pssh)
session_id = cdm.open()
challenge = cdm.get_license_challenge(session_id, pssh)
license = await client.get_license(
    streams.media_id,
    challenge=challenge,
    token=streams.token
)
cdm.parse_license(session_id, license)
for key in cdm.get_keys(session_id, "CONTENT"):
    print(f"{key.kid.hex}:{key.key.hex()}")
cdm.close(session_id)
# Deleting active streams will prevent Crunchyroll HTTP 420 (too_many_queued_streams) error.
await client.delete_active_stream(
    streams.media_id,
    token=streams.token
)
```

Output:

```bash
056ec1ca849e350181753cacc9bd404b:2307a188ecd8de3859b71b30791f171d
```

> [!TIP]
> Decryption keys are universally applicable to both video and audio streams, maintaining consistency across all available formats.
